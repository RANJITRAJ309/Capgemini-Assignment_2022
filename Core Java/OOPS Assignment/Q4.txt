1. IDE prompts me to change the class to abstract
2. It shows error while trying to create object of abstract class.
3. If we don't it prompts the programmer to implement all methods
4,5. It throws an error and program doesn't compile.
6.we can have both type of methods in an abstract class, either the function can be defined with the body of it can be undefined with the abstract keyword.
